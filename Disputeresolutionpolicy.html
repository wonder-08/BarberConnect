        <h1>BarberConnect Dispute Resolution Policy</h1>
        <p>This Dispute Resolution Policy ("Policy") sets out the procedures for resolving disputes between users ("you") of the BarberConnect platform ("Platform") and between you and BarberConnect ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"). This Policy is incorporated by reference into our Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Notifying BarberConnect of a Dispute</h2>
        <p>If you have a dispute with another user of the Platform or with BarberConnect, you should report the dispute to us via our help center or by sending an email to support@barberconnect.com. Please include all relevant information, so we can understand and attempt to resolve the dispute.</p>

        <h2>2. BarberConnectâ€™s Role in Disputes</h2>
        <p>BarberConnect is not obliged to mediate or resolve any dispute you have with another user or a service provider. While we may help facilitate resolution of disputes, we have no control over and do not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of service providers to provide services; or that a user or service provider will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p>

        <h2>3. Dispute Resolution Procedure</h2>
        <p>If we elect to help resolve a dispute, we will do so in good faith based solely on our interpretation of our policies. Our resolution of a dispute is final with respect to the Platform.</p>

        <h2>4. Escalation to Third-Party Mediation</h2>
        <p>If a dispute can't be resolved between users or between a user and BarberConnect directly, you agree that the dispute shall be referred to a neutral third-party mediator agreed upon by both parties. The costs of such mediation will be borne equally by the parties involved in the dispute.</p>

        <h2>5. Arbitration Agreement</h2>
        <p>If mediation does not resolve the dispute, you agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the BarberConnect Platform will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The laws of South Africa apply.</p>

        <h2>6. Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p>You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to this Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy from time to time.        <p>If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Dispute Resolution Policy, please email us at support@barberconnect.com.</p>
